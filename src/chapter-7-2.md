### 2. Consider Expertise

Consider whether the task requires a specific expertise or skill set that another team member possesses.

### 3. Assess Priority

Assess whether the task is a top priority or could be delayed without significant consequences.

### 4. Review Your Role

Review your role and responsibilities within the organization to determine whether delegating certain tasks makes sense given your overall goals and objectives.
